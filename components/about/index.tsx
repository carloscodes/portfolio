                        Hello world! My name is Carlos Chavarria and I enjoy making software. 
                        My interest in software development started back in 2016 when I took a java programming 
                        class in college. I was intrigued and decided to pursue CS at the University of California Irvine.
                        I took it upon myself to learn web and app development when I
                        was not studying and managed to run a relatively successful software consulting business for a couple years after college.
                        I built web apps, stripe backends with paypal and zapier integrations, as well as a fully fledged iOS app with in-app payment support.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        My main focus these days is learning and a continous refinement of my skills. I am also teaching my daughter
                        about software and business in my spare time. I run her small business for her ðŸ˜Š
